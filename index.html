            <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic <br>

                Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.<br>
                
                Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case. </p>

    <h2> Why should we spread mental health awareness</h2>
    
    
   </section>
   <section class="pimg4">
    <div class="ptext">
        <span class="textBg">
            <p>By making a concerted effort to spread mental health awareness, we can work to de-stigmatize how we think about, approach, and identify mental health issues in our society. <br>

                Having those tough conversations and admitting there’s a problem means we can come up with a solution. We can start removing the shame and fear that are often associated with topics surrounding poor mental health. Doing so can increase the likelihood of someone reaching out when they need help.<br>
                
                Asking for help is a sign of strength. Working together allows us to begin building a foundation that respects and honors the importance of good mental health.<br>
                
                Another benefit to focusing on mental health awareness is that it can make signs and symptoms of certain conditions more well-known. Early intervention is predictive of how successful mental health treatment will be for many conditions. The earlier someone is diagnosed and begins treatment, the more likely it is that they’ll be able to manage their condition and improve their mental health.</p>
